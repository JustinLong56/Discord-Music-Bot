# Discord-Music-Bot
Allows user to play music on discord. Just add your own Discord bot Token to use
This bot is "for private use" or "just for fun" since Youtube is cracking down music bots like these that are published for public server uses
Note: 
1. Will only work as long the bot is running
2. Must use your discord developer bot token (Make sure Administrator is checked)
3. The developer portal tab must stay open while using 

P.S. Might have to reset token and paste in a new one if bugged
